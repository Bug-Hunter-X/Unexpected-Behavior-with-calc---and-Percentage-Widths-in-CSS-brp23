The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function and percentage values:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This code intends to make an element's width 50% of its parent's width minus 10 pixels.  However, if the parent element doesn't have a defined width (e.g., it's using percentage width itself or `auto`), the `calc()` function might not calculate correctly, potentially leading to unexpected results or rendering issues. The `50%` part of the calculation will not be able to resolve until the parent element's width is known. 

This is more subtle than typical CSS errors, and the incorrect behavior is only observed in specific contexts.
