To resolve this issue, ensure the parent container of the `.element` has a defined width. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

**1. Set a fixed width for the parent:**

```css
.parent {
  width: 800px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

**2. Use a different approach without `calc()`:**

```css
.element {
  width: 50%;
  margin-right: -10px; /* Or use padding or other techniques to adjust the width */
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

**3. Ensure the parent's width is defined implicitly (less reliable):**
If the parent's width is determined by its content, make sure the content is present to give a defined width. However, this method might be less reliable because it depends on the content's size.

Choosing the best solution depends on the specific layout and design requirements.
